### Step 1: Setting Up Docker Containers

#### 1. Create the Directory Structure

First, create a directory for your project. Inside this directory, create subdirectories for the database and the SQL queries.

```bash
mkdir sql_recommendation_system
cd sql_recommendation_system
mkdir db queries
```

#### 2. Prepare the PostgreSQL Database

- **Create a Dockerfile for PostgreSQL** (optional, as we can use the official image directly).
- **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file** to define the services.

Hereâ€™s an example of what your `docker-compose.yml` file might look like:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: recommendation_db
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    volumes:
      - ./db:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  sql_client:
    image: postgres:latest
    depends_on:
      - db
    entrypoint: ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]  # Keeps the container running
```

#### 3. Prepare the SQL Data

- **Create a CSV file** named `train_purchases.csv` and `train_session.csv` in the `db` directory. For this example, you can create dummy data or use the first 20 lines of your actual CSV files.

- **Create an SQL script** to load the data into the PostgreSQL database. Create a file named `init.sql` in the `db` directory with the following content:

```sql
CREATE TABLE purchases (
    session_id VARCHAR(255),
    item_id INT,
    purchase_date TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE sessions (
    session_id VARCHAR(255),
    item_id INT,
    view_date TIMESTAMP
);

COPY purchases(session_id, item_id, purchase_date)
FROM '/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/train_purchases.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;

COPY sessions(session_id, item_id, view_date)
FROM '/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/train_session.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;
```

#### 4. Start the Docker Containers

Now that you have your `docker-compose.yml` and SQL initialization script ready, you can start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will start the PostgreSQL database and execute the SQL script to create the tables and load the data from the CSV files.

#### 5. Verify the Setup

To verify that everything is set up correctly, you can connect to the PostgreSQL database using a PostgreSQL client (like `psql`) or a GUI tool (like pgAdmin) and check if the tables `purchases` and `sessions` have been created and populated with data.

You can connect to the database using the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> psql -U user -d recommendation_db
```

Replace `<container_id>` with the actual ID of the PostgreSQL container, which you can find by running `docker ps`.

### Next Steps

Once you have completed Step 1, you can proceed to Step 2, which involves creating a Flask API to interact with the PostgreSQL database. If you need assistance with that step, feel free to ask!
