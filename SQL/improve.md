### Step 1: Setting Up Docker Containers

#### 1. Create the Directory Structure
First, create a directory for your project. Inside this directory, create subdirectories for the database and the SQL queries.

```bash
mkdir sql_recommendation_system
cd sql_recommendation_system
mkdir db queries
```

#### 2. Prepare the PostgreSQL Database

- **Create a Dockerfile for PostgreSQL** (optional, as we can use the official image directly):
  
  You can skip creating a Dockerfile and directly use the official PostgreSQL image in the `docker-compose.yml`.

- **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file** in the root of your project directory:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: recommendation_db
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - ./db:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d

  sql:
    image: postgres:latest
    depends_on:
      - db
    command: ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]  # Keeps the container running
```

#### 3. Prepare the CSV Data

- **Create a `train_purchases.csv` and `train_session.csv`** file in the root directory or in a designated data directory. For this example, we will assume you have the first 20 lines of the CSV files ready.

- **Create a SQL script to load the data into PostgreSQL**. Create a file named `init.sql` in the `db` directory:

```sql
CREATE TABLE purchases (
    session_id VARCHAR(255),
    item_id INT,
    purchase_date TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE sessions (
    session_id VARCHAR(255),
    item_id INT,
    view_date TIMESTAMP
);

COPY purchases(session_id, item_id, purchase_date)
FROM '/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/train_purchases.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;

COPY sessions(session_id, item_id, view_date)
FROM '/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/train_session.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;
```

#### 4. Start the Docker Containers

- Open a terminal in the root of your project directory and run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will start the PostgreSQL database and initialize it with the data from your CSV files.

#### 5. Verify the Database

- You can connect to the PostgreSQL database using a PostgreSQL client (like `psql`, DBeaver, or pgAdmin) to verify that the tables have been created and populated correctly.

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> psql -U user -d recommendation_db
```

Replace `<container_id>` with the actual container ID of your PostgreSQL service.

#### 6. Test SQL Queries

- You can create a new SQL file in the `queries` directory to write and test your SQL queries against the database.

### Summary

At this point, you have successfully completed Step 1 by setting up a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container and loading it with data from CSV files. The next step would be to create a Flask API to interact with this database, as outlined in Step 2 of the README.md. Would you like to proceed with that?
